# README - My Website

This is my personal website designed to showcase my skills at frontend development.  
It is built using [NextJS](https://www.nextjs.org) and [React](https://www.reactjs.org/) in TypeScript.  
I have learnt all of this myself by reading the docs and months of experimentation.  
I hope you like it!
